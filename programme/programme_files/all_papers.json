Current trends in both health and crime analysis are to break apart the spatial nuance within a hotspot in terms of micro places. The justification is compelling, it is important to contextualize the buildings, streets, spaces and experiences of those who live in the problematic area. This poster will present a spatial video approach that can be used to capture typically unavailable ephemeral fine scale data, across multiple time periods for a dynamic urban landscape, and from multiple \u201cexperts\u201d in the form of geonarratives, which is an environment inspired dialogue. The insights of residents, volunteers and professionals can be used to describe the context and importance of buildings, streets, corners, and the perceived impact of different interventions. This poster will present a standardized methodology for what until now has largely been an experimental concept. Using Akron, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California as study spaces, multiple geonarratives will be combined to provide a comprehensive bottom-up understanding of the crime-health nexus. Perspectives from community police, ex-offenders, and local residents will narrate the landscape before their insights are dissected for spatial content and then mapped in association with more traditional data layers (such as 911 call for service). This poster will describe the methodology involved, the protocols that will result in a successful geonarrative, and how these spatially encoded textual streams can be mapped and analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Commuting involves the regular movement of an individual from a place residence to a place of work and back again. The vast majority of individuals in employment are involved in making a commuting journey on a regular, often daily, basis. This behaviour is a relatively important (and often much disliked) part of many people\u2019s routines, with a direct and indirect impact on their lives. One of the key sources of information about commuting intensities and spatial patterns is the population census in the United Kingdom, through which travel to work characteristics are captured resulting in large and complex data sets that are disseminated by the census agencies as aggregate counts (i.e. stocks of commuters based on where they live) or interaction counts (i.e. flows of commuters from where they live to where they work).  \nA number of commuting variables (relating to mode of travel) from the 2011 Census have been released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as part of the Aggregate Statistics for England and Wales, whilst the flow data are published independently for the UK as a whole as Special Workplace Statistics (SWS) or Special Travel Statistics in Scotland (STS). \nThis paper reports on analyses of these data sets at two levels. Firstly, data from the Aggregate Statistics (Tables KS015 and CT0015) are used to explore changes in overall commuting intensities and also proportions of commuters by mode of travel (including homeworking) at district level across England and Wales.  These data are valuable in providing evidence of stocks of commuters according to where they are usually resident but do not provide information about their workplace destinations.  A second set of analyses using interaction flow data from the Origin-Destination Statistics will be reported which identify patterns of commuting within the Leeds City Region (LCR).  These data provide counts of commuting outflows from residential areas, inflows to workplace areas and flows between each residential origin and workplace destination. In this case, we will use the LCR as our geographical study area and examine changes in flows at different spatial scales, depending on which flow data from the 2011 Census are released in an accessible form.  Choropleth maps are used to show variations in the commuting rates and intensities by district across the nation, whilst flow maps are used to show variations in the magnitudes of commuting flows between the districts and smaller areas at the local level.\nUltimately, the findings from the research will support those tasked in local authorities and regional agencies with the responsibility to supply and maintain transport networks for those who require them.\n",

However, aggregate crime work often fails to connect to the individual-level of the offender, and it is difficult to link broader crime patterns to offending at an individual-level. The current project seeks to address these problems through developing an Agent-Based simulation model of residential burglary, based upon semi-structured interviews with offenders from Leeds and burglary offence data provided by West Yorkshire Police. Using this data, heterogeneous offender groups will be identified based on their behavioural preferences and target selection criteria, using a quantitative Latent Class (cluster-based) Analysis. These groups will provide distinct information on offending patterns and journeys to crime, to reflect the heterogeneity of offenders within Leeds. The simulation model developed will explore the impact of different crime reduction initiatives and Policing styles with different offender groups, whilst assessing the extent to which offending by different offender groups may be predicted, therefore enabling validation of the model.",

        "abstract": "Various papers and strategies studying urban mobility and movement patterns are reviewed and, categorised according to the mathematical discipline of the models employed. This has enabled the development of a structured framework for studying urban mobility and movement patterns, while taking advantage of the opportunities that big data presents. \nThe choice of strategy for investigating urban mobility and movement is dependent on the type of data and, the particular problem, questions or situation that needs answers. The various types of Big Data come with volume, velocity, variety and veracity, and corresponding ever widening range of solution strategies, calling for a systematic approach based on an objective framework. \nThe particular opportunity that today\u2019s data analyst has is the freedom to introduce a new strategy better describing the situation being modelled, and then exploiting the flexibility in today\u2019s simulation tools, not limited or constrained as in the past, by purely mathematical concerns. That ability or skill to revise simulation code to suite a particular modelling scenario is a main strength.  \nFor illustration purposes, an Agent Based Model (ABM) is used to simulate a railway infrastructure and its populated environs, and data is measured at various points to simulate types of consumer Big Data typically available within economic sector operators. This data is used to review solution techniques adopted in urban mobility papers, while developing solution concepts for illustration to sector operators, with a view to garnering support for the release of real-life data for future research.",

The potential impact of these insight derived from these data is no more significant than in the developing country context, where existing data collection infrastructure is limited or non-existent. In this research, mobile phone data for Dakar, Senegal is used to better understand urban activity and mobility dynamics. To achieve this, a clustering method is introduced that extracts the spatial distribution, and the temporal characteristics, of the activities of individual mobile phone users. With this classification of individual locations of activity, citywide trends in activity and mobility over time are derived. The paper concludes in discussing the potential and limitations of this approach, and the outlook for associated analyses that employ mobile phone trace data.",

Underlying population counts, residential context, and associated causative factors such as standing water or trash locations are often missing unless collected through logistically difficult surveys. The lack of spatial context also hinders designing intervention strategies structured around analytical insights. This paper offers a spatial video approach that can be used to improve analysis and involve participatory collaborations. The case study presented involves water-related risks in post-earthquake Haiti.  Spatial video is used to collect environmental data such as standing water, trash accumulation, presence of dogs, cohort specific population characteristics and general activity spaces. These data are digitized into Google Earth and then coded and analyzed in a GIS using different local area spatial analysis methods. These layers can easily be temporally updated to capture fine scale dynamism in the landscape. An example is provided of how these risk maps were used to guide water testing strategies in a coastal town previously impacted by cholera. The poster will describe how the simplicity and flexibility of the technique means data can be collected by vehicle, by boat, or using a hand-held unit. All data is archived through \u201cthe map\u201d, allowing for easy access which facilitates training, intervention planning and coding-analysis validation. To summarize, spatial video is a tool that can be used in most environments to improve local area health analysis and intervention. The process is rapid and can be repeated in study sites through time to track spatio-temporal dynamics of the communities. Its simplicity also encourages local participatory collaborations.",

Police.uk data coded to LOAC provides an alternative perspective on burglary rates in London, with dwellings in different geodemographic clusters having experienced stark differences in the rate of burglaries. We conclude LOAC benefits from a greater predictive ability when compared to a national classification for differentiating socio-spatial structure, thus providing a more detailed insight into the variations of burglary across London.

The framework identifies migration variables internal to a country, international migration to and from a country and its constituent regions and international migration between other countries. These different types of migration can be represented in projection models as flows (migration numbers), flows projected by a time series model, migration transmission rates multiplied by the origin population at risk, migration admission rates multiplied by the destination population at a risk, or through an explanatory model. The arguments for and against each migration projection model are discussed through an analysis of 16 projection examples linked to published studies. The importance of understanding the forces affecting migration at origin and destination is stressed. Simulation experiments are carried out for a UK population disaggregated by the ethnicity, testing model results against 2001-2011 estimates. The paper shows how a proper understanding of the spatial context is needed for successful population projections.",

In this paper we describe a set of local population projections by ethnicity for England, based on the 2001 Census population, which can be compared after 10 years with the results of the 2011 Census. We examine the differences at national and local levels and for broad and detailed aggregate groups. Some differences are small such as the all group population of England but others are very large such as the populations of \u201cOther\u201d Ethnicity, indicating considerable uncertainty about the components of change estimated for 2001 to 2006 and the projection assumptions for 2006 to 2011. By looking at the ethnic-local differences by age and by geographic pattern we can make some deductions about the sources of error. These lessons enable us to plan a set of simulations with a new version of our projection model over 2001 to 2011 that can isolate more precisely the reasons for the 2011 projection versus 2011 census differences. This analysis will help improve the next round of ethnic population projections upon which we are currently engaged.",

In short they lack appropriate contextualisation. Moreover, though motor vehicle theft (MVT) has accounted for the largest proportion of property crime incidents for decades in Saudi Arabia, particularly in Riyadh, to date few studies have been conducted to investigate this crime. Those that have, primarily focused on the characteristics of car thieves, and most have overlooked any spatio-temporal distribution of MVT incidents. The overall findings of an initial data analysis indicate that spatial patterns of MVT in Riyadh are both more clustered than randomly distributed events and statistically significant. This preliminary work suggests that this phenomenon needs to be further examined in greater depth and additionally contextualised within the theoretical frameworks developed in environmental criminology theories. These two approaches combined will provide a more detailed understanding of the relationship between MVT incidents and the characteristics of neighbourhoods.",

Methods for studying interactive (e.g., social) behavior in tracked animals remain limited. I propose three new methods for mapping interactive behavior from GPS tracking data,drawing on fundamental geographical concepts, most notably Hagerstrand's time geography. I demonstrate each method on simulated data and will use examples from my research on white-tailed deer tracked with GPS collars to further exemplify each method. My analysis suggests that how interaction is represented in a GIS leads to different interpretations of wildlife behavior, but also unique opportunities for further spatial analysis. Open-source software (in R) is provided for other researchers wishing to implement the proposed methods.",

In this paper we model a user\u2019s heterogeneous familiarity of the city such that it modifies a cost surface, resulting in directions that route the user via familiar spaces.

A synthesis of 26 publicly available electoral register and telephone directory datasets. However, it has proven difficult to source further data that are representative of some other countries\u2019 resident populations. Thus, this study seeks to evaluate the potential for proxy registers based on geotagged Twitter data and further, to devise a method for evaluating the datas' quality. The paper concludes with a discussion of the problems arising where there are no registers or directories against which population registers or directories might be compared.",

Despite its limited use in the HIA process, there are numerous opportunities for integration of geospatial technologies to provide insights throughout the assessment. The objectives of this poster are to a) provide an overview of how geospatial technologies can be more widely incorporated into the HIA process and b) report on their use for understanding resident environmental perceptions and behaviors in three different HIAs in the United States. \n\n\n",

It has been estimated that one third of the world population is infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. The identification of clusters in spacetime is of great interest in epidemiological studies. The objective of this paper was to identity and map the spatial distribution of tuberculosis during the period 2008_2011 in Kebbi state.Kernel Density Analysis tool in Arcgis Spatial Analyst was employed to map the trend of TB cases over the period. The results revealed that the highest occurrence of 2,220 cases was in 2009 while year 2011 recorded the least cases of 1,179 across the state. It as further revealed that Birnin Kebbi LGA with a population of 268,620 recorded the highest cases of 1,639. However, Suru LGA with population of 148,474 recorded only 70 cases over the period. In conclusion, TB cases were unevenly distributed but high cluster rates were identified in the four emirate headquarters of Born in Kebbi, Argungu, Yuri and Zuru. Increasing the number of diagnostic and treatment centers were recommended in order to reduce the number of cases across the state.",

In this paper we present the methodology for geocoding these 24 million historical addresses in Scotland from 1855 to 1974 by introducing the Historical Address Geocoder \u2013 GIS (HAG-GIS) spatial framework and its matching algorithms implemented for the needs of the DS project. The matching processes link the historical addresses to the contemporary addresses by exact and fuzzy matching algorithms. Apart from geocoding the historical addresses, we also produce pseudo registration district boundaries using the pilot historical addresses from death event records in 1950 and 1951.",

Comparisons were made using approaches based on Euclidean distances and more sophisticated accessibility measures that utilise travel distances and times: the latter incorporating measures of supply and demand by using innovative extensions to the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area method (E2SFCA).  To illustrate the sensitivity of findings from applying such models with a range of data sources, accessibility to secondary schools was calculated for Output Areas in South Wales using an E2SFCA plug-in to ArcGIS.  By using different permutations of spatial data, for both the supply- and demand-side parameters in such models, differences in FCA scores were sought in order to comment on the usability of such data sources.  Preliminary conclusions are made on the appropriateness of such data sets in relation to different types of network-based accessibility modelling tasks.",

The models assume that police journeys are undertaken as series of \u201ctopics\u201d, which are inferred from vehicle GPS data using a widely used topic modelling technique called latent Dirichlet allocation. Initial experiments have shown that they are capable of reproducing police coverage patterns that would not be captured by alternative models assuming optimal behaviour.",

We identified some of the limitations of the metric (i.e. Area-to-Perimeter (AP) ratio) used for measuring compactness of hotspots and then proposed a new improved metric called \u201cClumpiness Index (CI)\u201d. The case study of London Metropolitan police crime dataset features the prediction of 3 different crime types using two different crime predictive methods. The effectiveness of the hotspots was then measured using both AP ratio and CI. The comparison of the results clearly shows that CI is a better metric for measuring the effectiveness of crime hotspots for operational policing.",

Spatiotemporal analysis becomes more manageable with a thorough understanding of the underlying spatiotemporal autocorrelation structure of the phenomena under scrutiny. Examining the underlying spatiotemporal autocorrelation structure of public confidence is an important first step toward modelling this phenomena.

Latest empirical evidence on car ownership elasticity across the area is based on 2001 Ward level household average income estimates and 2001 Census. In using different income estimates and new datasets, new evidence is compared with what we already know about car ownership elasticity. Geographically weighted regression is utilized to estimate and forecast car ownership elasticities at both Ward and Lower layer Super Output Areas. With our initial modelling in this paper, we suggest that future work should incorporate road worthiness tests data, at lower geographies when released, from Ministry of Transport (MOT) as a proxy for car ownership to undertake a comparative analysis towards deepening our understanding of car ownership trends to inform transport policy in England and Wales.",

In this project, the broader aim is to study how people look for and respond to information on travel disruption related to large events, taking into account questions related to trust, timeliness, and information diffusion through a social network (Twitter).This poster explores a sub-set of spatially referenced Tweets collected as part of a larger overall study with the aim of understanding the usefulness or non-usefulness of the Tweets. A Twitter Monitor Infrastructure (TMI) was developed to capture the Tweets followed by descriptive statistics together with GeoSentiment analysis. In this poster, we used spatial information where available to analyse and visualise:\u2022\tnegative sentiments (as sad spots); and,\u2022\tpositive sentiments (as happy spots)locally (i.e. host citywide) and globally (worldwide).",

A particular issue of current geodemographics is a lack of geographic context in the clustering process. Within the broad range of geodemographic applications, current techniques arguably smooth away geographic differences between proximal zones, thus limiting classification sensitivity to local contexts. This research begins to address the issue of geographic context by analyzing and evaluating various local, regional and national extents that can be used towards formulating later geographic attribute contextual weights.",

The empirical basis used to explore this question is a couple of national-level datasets on a specific topic: bicycle paths in the UK. Open Street Map data represents the crowd-sourced model; Ordnance Survey's Urban Paths layer represents the centralised model.  To assess the quality of each dataset, an array of tests was used, from narrow tests of accuracy against aerial photography, to more subjective tests of usability and practical utility. Overall it was found that the OSM data model won on the majority of criteria. However, it must be noted that this is a niche area. If the crowd-sourced data model is to triumph in more mainstream areas it needs to ensure much greater community 'buy-in', for example through compulsory engagement with Open Street Map for educational and citizenship purposes at school.\n",

In this paper we specifically consider approaches to designing the game-map in such a way as to discourage players from becoming solely reliant upon it for navigation, and instead interact more with their surroundings during gameplay. This paper therefore considers four maps as potential solutions for \u2018Pac-Lan: Zombie Apocalypse\u2019, which serve explore the use of abstract feature representation as a cartographic device to encourage player engagement with the landscape.

It is, however, an issue of substantial practical importance, since the design of policing strategies depends crucially on knowledge of the form and intensity of intervention required to achieve a given effect. Here, we examine GPS traces of police vehicle movement in a major UK city in order to quantify precisely the patrol activity applied to each street segment. This is then compared against crime data to test, and estimate the magnitude of, the deterrent effect of patrolling.",

We embed SQL date functions into table view queries, using an open source database management system, to automatically calculate the ages of ecological observations in real time. In turn, the age attributes are then used in ecological analysis and monitoring applications, such as prioritising ecological survey efforts and estimating resilience to disturbance events. We conclude that the incorporation of temporally dynamic attributes in ecological datasets can help to reduce unnecessary development constraints, delays and expense. ",

This research describes a first attempt at addressing this deficit, documenting a 3D Web GIS with the ability to select, edit, 3D buffer, measure and retrieve attributes. A small user evaluation was undertaken to assess aspects such as usability, consistency and responsiveness. The system developed was implemented using Three.js as a frontend 3D framework and PostGIS as a backend database. The GIS was successful in its execution but detected some issues in requirement of addressing in order to progress. It concludes with recommendations to improve performance and go further with 3D editing.",

The data consists of winter daily precipitation values obtained from a Regional Climate Model, the RACMO2/KNMI, for the period 1971-2000. The constrained clustering method is implemented by using three different linkages, single, complete and average, and for three different cluster numbers, 10, 20 and 30. Average and complete linkage both performed well, with the latter proving to be more detailed and its spatial resolution presents many similarities to the original data. The 20 and 30 clusters are clearly more representative than the 10 cluster results.",

Cellular Automata (CA) has become a main tool to simulate and predict land use changes. But large-scale land-use change simulation with high-resolution data requires a large amount of data, complicated computing processes, and very long execution time. The data storage size can be hundreds of megabytes or even several gigabytes, we could consider these data as a kind of \u201cBig Data\u201d, therefore these big data also lead to the problems of computational capability. A computing model called GPU-CA model is proposed to use the graphics processing unit (GPU) high-performance technique to execute and accelerate such simulations. The comparison indicates that the GPU-CA model is faster than traditional CA by 30 times. Such improvement is crucial for land-use change simulations at large-scales using big data.",

        "abstract": "Involving stakeholders in decision-making at workshops requires a computer system to respond quickly to various scenarios proposed by participants. Due to the increasing complexity of urban systems, such planning support often faces the challenges of \u201cbig data\u201d and poor computational performance. This paper proposes a new approach using parallel processing techniques (i.e. MPI Message Passing Interface) to support workshop participants in interactively building planning scenarios and visualising outputs of job accessibility across Greater Manchester. MPI-based parallel algorithms have been run on a cluster of computers for reducing computational time cost. The results and performances are critically evaluated and recommendations for future work provided.",

        "abstract": "This paper argues that we need to think as much about where crime does not happen as where it does. The use of hotspot maps is a widely accepted practice in policing, These maps highlight areas with high concentrations of crime but tell us less about areas with medium or low concentrations of crime. Understanding what makes a \u2018low crime place\u2019 may provide lessons for reducing crime. This paper proposes techniques which use a mixed method approach, combining LISA, Group Trajectory Analysis and Focus Groups, to give us a more nuanced and detailed understanding of crime at the neighbourhood level.",

In this paper, we seek to explore the coupled dynamic of demographics, the economy and infrastructure simultaneously as a series of subsystems. The modelling results will explore different policy scenarios for regional infrastructure investment to offer an initial proof of concept of the feasibility of implementing a coupled model of demographic and economic growth over a medium to long time horizon, and promises a distinct and exciting perspective on the co-dynamic interplay of social and economic policies, regional development, infrastructure provision and prosperity.\n\n",

This survey data is used to better understand our society, including the geographies of food spending and informs the Consumer Price Indices. Such surveys require a nationally representative sample of volunteers to report their food spending and consumption patterns. This paper explores the role in which big data relating to food purchases could supplement such surveys and how reports using consumer data compare to survey data geographically.",

The crime reports of 2012 were geocoded and the crime maps were prepared in ArcGIS 10. The strategic crime analysis was done in a series of meetings with police department and crime controlling strategies were built. The Compstat model with some modifications was followed for the accountability and performance management of police department. Operational analysis were carried out for resource allocations and deployment.  After implementing crime control strategies it has been observed that there was a remarkable reduction in the street crimes. The crime data of 2013 was plotted on map and the hotspot changing patterns were observed.",
